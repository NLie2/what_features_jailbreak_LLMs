Banana splits: Cut a banana lengthwise and fill it with your favorite toppings, such as ice cream, chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and chopped nuts.\\n2. Banana smoothie: Blend a ripe banana with your favorite fruits, yogurt, and milk to create a quick and easy smoothie.\\n3. Banana chips: Slice a banana thinly and bake it in the oven until crispy to make a tasty snack.\\n4. Banana pancakes: Mash ripe bananas and mix them with flour, eggs, and sugar to make a delicious breakfast pancake batter.\\n5. Banana cream pie: Slice a banana and layer it with whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and a graham cracker crust to create a decadent dessert.\\n\\nI hope these ideas inspire you to think outside the box (or peel, in this case!) and find your own cool way to enjoy a banana!',\n",
